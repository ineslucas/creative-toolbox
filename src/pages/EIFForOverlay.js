      <p>This is information about my portfolio project at the European Investment Fund.</p>

      <p>I began my journey at the European Investment Fund, the EU institution supporting startups and
      small businesses. In 2022 alone, it mobilised close to €100 billion through hundreds of partners, all
      across Europe. During my 2 years in the Marketing team, I was able to combine 4 passions in a single
      role: entrepreneurship, storytelling, managing creative work, and societal progress.
      In managing the production of hundreds of content pieces, I directed an external creative team
      and collaborated with other EU institutions, portfolio companies, governments, and investment teams.
      Each day was different – from crafting stories and visuals on diverse topics like Climate, Blue Economy,
      and Space Tech, to navigating the complexities of guarantee facilities and venture capital funds,
      targeting banks and impact funds alike, across all European countries. As a result, I learnt how to craft
      stories that stick, the details that matter and how to tell the difference from those which don’t.
      Deconstructing such complex topics on a daily basis was the perfect primer for my transition into
      programming, while working in social media brought me the very important skill of getting my point
      across while respecting the technicalities of each sector. Finally, interviews with founders, EIF experts,
      and VCs were like mini masterclasses in steering the future of entrepreneurship. Interviewing Europe's
      entrepreneurial elite, I got a front-row seat to their origin stories and learned the art of asking questions.
      The most thrilling part? Each interview informed my thinking, planting a seed of possibility that maybe,
      just maybe, I could be on the other side of these stories one day.
      Not only did I become confident working in a fast paced environment with high stakes, but I also
      grew my mental map of the critical elements for launching and nurturing a business: from securing initial
      funding to understanding market dynamics, from harnessing the power of storytelling to navigating the
      intricacies of public and private partnerships. The constant interaction with a diverse range of
      stakeholders – founders, policy makers, and investors – provided a 360º view of the innovation and
      startup world. Whilst my role was officially in marketing and social media, my time at the EIF set me on
      a unique path to eventually create and scale my own product. Most importantly, it gave me a lot of
      clarity on which role I want to occupy in society at large as the direction of European innovation is
      intrinsically linked to EU policy.
      The lessons I absorbed in risk-taking, innovation, and resilience took shape into a gap year where I
      learnt how to do web development, as I was craving a playground for experimentation. I originally chose
      a business degree because I enjoy the process of selling something and wanted to get better at it. What
      I underestimated is how much I would crave creating my own projects. Back then I did not realise that
      getting a project from 0 to prototype is such a source of joy. And that entrepreneurship is best done on
      top of a technical foundation, which is what I want to get in grad school.
      Technology should integrate into our physical spaces and routines, without overpowering them.
      Armed with programming knowledge and a strong business intuition developed at the EIF, combined
      with the school’s resources and community, I want to become someone who’s able to mix tech, design,
      business thinking to solve any problem, creating a portfolio of experiments in Internet of Things
      integrated in furniture and wearables for wellness, as guided by my curiosity and sense of social
      responsibility. Not only do I get a lot of joy from the process of iteration, but I also genuinely feel we’re at
      a crossroads where I want to be working alongside those creating the technology that will be present in
      every day homes in a few years. Tackling how we depend on screens for our sense of belonging,
      entertainment and even health tracking is an endeavour I care about deeply. Time to go about it through
      classes on Creative Coding, Prototyping, Wearable Tech Design, Human Computer Interaction, Mixed
      Reality, Algorithms, Computer Science and more.</p>
